The goal of the Arduino Uno tollgate system project is to automate the toll collection procedure at toll plazas. To build an effective and user-friendly system, it combines a number of components, including an LCD display, an IR sensor, an RFID scanner, and a keypad. The tollgate barrier is moved by a servo motor, and further features include an RFID scanner for vehicle authentication, an IR sensor for detecting the presence of cars, an account-recharging keypad, and an LCD display for user feedback such as card balance, entry of car permited etc.
